# Estimation-of-KFM-Moment-and-Knee-Flexion-Angle-of-Multi-modal-Data-Using-TransPose-Architecture
The study of computational methods to predict Osteoarthritis with the Knee Flexion Moment are more active in the recent years. This project aims to propose the Deep learning model with method which uses TransPose model,
