# Estimation of KFM Moment and Knee Flexion Angle of Multi modal Data Using TransPose Architecture
The study of computational methods to predict Osteoarthritis with the Knee Flexion Moment are more active in the recent years. This project aims to propose the Deep learning model with method which uses TransPose model, which is Transformer application of Detecting Pose and it was implemented to reduce computational cost as this uses 6 sensors required to detect the pose of the leg which can challenge the state of the art model, OpenPose which uses 16 sensors are required for the similar experiment. The dataset used for the experiment is a Multi-modal data , which consists of IMU sensor data and the video data which Walking data from 14 subjects were recorded with eight IMUs and two smartphone cameras and the walking speeds consists of 3 different speeds 0.3,0.5,0.7 m/s. Through this project, the model has been able to detect the key points of the leg and was able to calculate the Knee Flexion Moment at every frame of the video data. More experiments should be performed to validate the result which was obtained through this project. We propose this model to use to analyze and visualize leg movements, estimate knee angles, and perform Biomechanical Analysis like Knee Flexion Moment based on the pose estimation results.
